                <p>Toucan was created to help us feel more connected, understood, and heard. The benefits of speaking to
                    another person are well documented, but existing social and professional support options are leaving
                    many people unfulfilled. In a world where we are all constantly buried in our social media and text
                    messages, we want to revitalize the audio call and give you a meaningful way to open up to someone
                    facing a similar life stage or event. We want to give you a chance to reciprocate and lend an ear to
                    someone in need of an outlet.

                <h1>It all sounds great, but what does the Toucan app actually do?</h1>
                <p>Toucan connects you, one-on-one, with another user for a conversation we call Huddles. When you
                    schedule your Huddle you will choose whether you want to speak or listen, and you will be paired
                    with someone doing the other role. Your Huddle will be similar to an audio phone call - no video to
                    maintain anonymity - and the direction of the conversation will be controlled by the Speaker
                    (Listener lines are muted until unmuted by the Speaker). Our users are people just like you.
                    Listeners are not professional peer Listeners, and Toucan is not professional therapy. It is a
                    community of users looking to speak and listen to peers, and to provide an extension to traditional
                    social support options.</p>

            <figure class="faq-single-content">
                <h1>How does matching work? Do I choose my match?</h1>
                <p>We will match you with another user based on availability, the need for one Speaker and one Listener
                    in each Huddle, and the category or lens the Speaker chooses for the Huddle (i.e. matching a new
                    parent with another new parent). You will not choose your match as users maintain their anonymity in
                    the app.</p>

            <figure class="faq-single-content">
                <h1>Why are users anonymous?</h1>
                <p>It can be difficult to fully open up to friends and family - they know you, you may fear judgment
                    from them, and you may not want to burden or concern them. Think about why people tend to speak to
                    the person next to them on an airplane or in a waiting room. At Toucan we want our Speakers to feel
                    safe and comfortable confiding in our Listeners. Anonymity helps provide this environment.</p>

            <figure class="faq-single-content">
                <h1>Why is the Listener’s line muted?</h1>
                <p>Friends and family want to help, and in that desire, they can interrupt, turn the conversation to
                    them, or otherwise inhibit you from speaking your mind. Professional therapy, on the other hand,
                    often allows people to speak freely and without fear of interruption. We wanted to harness that in
                    Toucan. However, the goal of the platform is not for the Speaker to just speak at the Listener for
                    the entire Huddle; Speakers are encouraged to unmute the line once they have shared if they want to
                    ask for input, and a 2-way conversation can then ensue.</p>

                    show Listeners how others are tackling similar life events. </p>

                            presence is any less important.

                            Keep in mind that Listeners are not trained professionals and are not expected to give you

                <h1>What if I need to reschedule my Huddle? </h1>
                <p>Huddles are live audio calls that by nature need both people to be present, but things do come up.
                    Here are some tips and guidelines:
                    If you need to reschedule, try to give as much notice as possible, then use the options in the
                    Scheduled Huddles section of the app to cancel and reschedule.
                    If you are a Speaker and cancel at least 24 hours ahead of your scheduled Huddle, you will not be
                    charged for your Huddle; if you cancel within 24 hours (or simply don't show up) you will be
                    charged.
                    If you are a Speaker and your Listener cancels or does not show up within 5 minutes of your
                    scheduled Huddle start time, you will not be charged.</p>

            <figure class="faq-single-content">
                <h1>How much does a Huddle cost? How do I purchase credits?</h1>
                <p>Each time you want to speak in a Huddle, you will be charged 1 credit (credits never expire!)
                    Listening is always free. There are a few ways to get credits:</p>
                <p>1. You can purchase them in the Toucan app, and will find options: ​1 credit for $12; 3 credits for
                    $30; 5 credits for $45; or 12 credits for $100.
                    <br>
                    2. You can receive a code from your employer, an organization you are affiliated with, or from a
                    friend who has purchased credits on your behalf.
                    <br>
                    3. You can earn 1 credit for each Huddle where you act as a Listener for someone else.</p>
