            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="important">The Toucan platform and products are currently for use only by residents of the United States. Please do not use Toucan if you are a resident of another country.</p>
            <p>Toucan App Inc (“Toucan”) is dedicated to securing the private information of its users (“User(s)”). This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes the information we collect, how we use it, and the standards and procedures we have implemented to safeguard your personal, non-public information.</p>
            <p>We receive a number of different types of information about you, including, but not limited to the information that you are required to provide when you sign up for the Toucan app and/or website (collectively with other Toucan products and services the “Platform”), as well as the information you choose to share during registration.</p>
            <p>If you are coming to the Platform through an employer or insurer payor program, such as an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), then there may be additional information collected by Toucan and these Parties. This information is typically collected to confirm your eligibility with the EAP or network benefit administrator or to provide you with access purchased by that employer/administrator and is not shared with your Provider (who will collect your contact information separately). Further, your Employer or the Employer of the subscriber of your benefits will not be provided this information (you likely already gave them similar information in your employee file unless you are a family member of an eligible employee).</p>
            <p>Except as permitted by law or as otherwise described below, Toucan does not disclose any personal information (“PI”) about its customers, or former customers to anyone. Toucan does not sell lists or customer information. Toucan does not collect Personal Health Information (“PHI”), as defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).</p>
            <h4>Information Toucan Collects for Customers</h4>
            <p>
                Toucan collects, retains, and uses PI from customers to include the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The information that's required when you sign up for the Platform, as well as the information you choose to share.</li>
                    <li>Required information which may include your email address, birthday, and gender. We use the return email addresses to answer the email we receive from you.</li>
                    <li>Usernames and User IDs, which are a way to identify you on Toucan.</li>
                    <li>"Public Information" which means the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.</li>
                    <li>Payment information</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Information Toucan may Share</h4>
            <p>Toucan keeps your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies or during an emergency circumstances). Generally, we only use your information within our company. However, sometimes we use third parties to process your information (for example as credit card payment providers). We require these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and we require that they not use your personal information for their own business purposes.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, information may be provided to third parties, including but not limited to Toucan partners, in aggregate and anonymized, regarding use of Toucan services, generally, aggregated responses to survey questions, and categories of data, demographics and usage data.</p>
            <h4>The Uses of the Collected Data by Toucan</h4>
            <p>Toucan uses non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Platform and to use in research and trend analysis. For example, we may tell a partner that X number of individuals categorized themselves into a certain category, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out a Platform survey or form, or used the platform, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. We only provide data to our partners, if any, after we have removed your name and any other personally identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people's data in a way that it no longer personally identifies you.</p>
            <p>Toucan uses non-identifying (De-Identified or “Safe Harbor” form) and aggregate information about responses to any questions/questionnaires posed to you (personal assessments, questions quantifying mood, etc), and the frequency of the utilization of the Toucan service. These efforts enhance program evaluation.</p>
            <p>The anonymous and aggregated data also may be published through various media platforms/academic journals. No personal identifying information is tied to the results, and Toucan does not share anything that could be used to identify your account or your private information.</p>
            <p>From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will contact you before we use your data for these new purposes to notify you of the policy change and to provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses.</p>
            <p>Toucan stores data only for as long as it is necessary to provide products and services to you and others, including those described above and for legal protections or as required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>
            <p>Toucan may enable access to public information that has been shared through our services.</p>
            <p>Toucan may allow service providers to access information so they can help us provide services. IP addresses are used to identify the location of Users, the number of visits from different locations, and also to block disruptive use; and to analyze and improve the services offered on our Platform, e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience.</p>
            <p>Certain information is needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some forms of processing (sending promotional information, commercial profiling, behavioral advertising, geo-location, etc. as applicable) may require the express consent of the User. Specific information may be shown on the pages of the Platform in connection with particular services or processing of Data provided by the Platform User.</p>
            <p>Upon request we provide Platform Users with access to a description of information that we maintain about them. Toucan uses industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our Platform. If you feel that this Platform is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at privacy@thetoucanapp.com.</p>
            <p>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos or other information, as applicable, you specifically grant Toucan a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty- free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Toucan (the “IP License”). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account, unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
            <p>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
            <h4>Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To any person when you authorize such disclosure;</li>
                    <li> To computer services consultants and technicians or other security consultants, in order to ensure the confidentiality and security for Users;</li>
                    <li>To financial service providers or consultants to carry out requested services, and/or to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims, or other liability;</li>
                    <li>To independent auditors or consultants in order to carry out institutional risk control;</li>
                    <li>To government or regulatory agencies, including self-regulatory organizations and to comply with a legal summons, court order, subpoena or a similar legal process, audit or investigation;</li>
                    <li>To swap data repositories</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h4>Protection: How We Protect Personal Information</h4>
            <p>Toucan maintains strict information security procedures, including physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, to protect the confidentiality of your information.</p>
            <h4>We Protect Nonpublic Personal Information</h4>
            <p>
                Toucan does the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Restricting access to customer information to only those personnel for whom the information is necessary;</li>
                    <li>Entering into written confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements with third party service providers for certain disclosures;</li>
                    <li>Maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with the relevant laws and regulations; and</li>
                    <li>Toucan uses firewall barriers and digital certifications to maintain the security of your information.</li>
                    <li>We do not collect any nonpublic PI about visitors on our Platform, unless information is provided to us voluntarily or derived from website navigation and usage of the Toucan Platform.</li>
                    <li>We may gather and analyze information regarding usage of our Platform, including domain name, the number of hits, the pages visited, previous/subsequent sites visited and length of Huddle. This information may be gathered by using cookies and/or similar technologies. Toucan uses cookies and similar technologies to track usage of the Platform and to address security issues. We may also use cookies to store your preferences relating to use of our Platform. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet, cell phone or other electronic device (referred to here as a "Device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your Device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a User visits their website in order to track traffic flows.  Cookies record information about your preferences and allow us to tailor Toucan to your interests. During the course or any visit to the Platform, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your Device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things such as finding out whether the Device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking for the cookie left there on the previous visit. Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyze the profile of our visitors so we can provide you with a better user experience.</li>
                </ul>
